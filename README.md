# 30hillsTEST

This is a simple social network simulation web app, written in JavaScript with nodejs and express framework

I have very little experience in javascript/express and no experience in web dev whatsoever so my code is probably more Java-ish than it should be.

To start the server, navigate to directory and execute "node ./server.js"






TODO improvements
1. there is no database implementation. The data is read from supplied json file and loaded as an object array at runtime. This is flawed; nonetheless it served well in creating the first demo.
2. organize server-side files and functions
3. organize client-side files and functions
4. gui for demo
5. tidy up
