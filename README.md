# 30hillsTEST

To start the server, navigate to root directory and execute "node ./server.js"

Relevant code is found in server.js and default.html

This is a simple social network simulation web app, written in JavaScript with nodejs and express framework

I have very little experience in javascript/express and no experience in web development whatsoever so my code is probably more Java-ish than it should be.

Dependencies:
1. Node.JS

TODO improvements
1. there is no database implementation. The data is read from supplied json file and loaded as an object array at runtime. This is flawed for many reasons; nonetheless it served well for a demo.
2. organize client-side files and functions and improve GUI/graphics of the demo
