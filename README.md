# 30hillsTEST

To start the server, navigate to directory and execute "node ./server.js"

This is a simple social network simulation web app, written in JavaScript with nodejs and express framework

I have very little experience in javascript/express and no experience in web development whatsoever so my code is probably more Java-ish than it should be.








TODO improvements
1. there is no database implementation. The data is read from supplied json file and loaded as an object array at runtime. This is flawed; nonetheless it served well for demo.
2. organize server-side files and functions
3. organize client-side files and functions
4. gui for demo
5. tidy up
